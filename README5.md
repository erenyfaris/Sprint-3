- *Shape and Reshape


2- Explain each method ..

* XML2 - Find the Maximum Depth():Converts XML files into csv file, this script is capable of converting extremely nested xml files.

This script utilize power of multiprocessing to convert huge data in less time.

* Decorators ():are a very powerful and useful tool in Python because it allows users to modify the behaviour of function or class.

Python functions can be treated as supreme citizens as objects.
pa:@decorator(params)  
def function_name():  
    '''Function implementation'''  

 *  Shape and Reshape(): Reshaping means changing the shape of an array.

The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.
pr:numpy.reshape(a, newshape, order='C')
