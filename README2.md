2- Explain each method ..

 * collections.Counter():Python Counter takes in input a list, tuple, dictionary, string, which are all iterable objects, and it will give you      output that will have the count of each element.
 p:list1 = ['x','y','z','x','x','x','y', 'z']
       
* DefaultDict Tutorial()   works exactly like a normal dict, but it is initialized with a function (“default factory”) that takes no arguments and   provides the default value for a nonexistent key.

* collections.namedtuple():present in the module, “collections“. Like dictionaries, they contain keys that are hashed to a particular value. But on contrary, it supports both access from key-value and iteration, the functionality that dictionaries
